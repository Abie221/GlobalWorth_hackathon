# ♻️ GreenPoints - Building a Habit for a Greener Future

Welcome to **GreenPoints**, a gamified sustainability app built during our hackathon journey. This project is a collaborative effort to incentivize eco-friendly habits, foster community engagement, and reward positive impact. 🌍

## 🚀 Our Journey

What started as a brainstorm around environmental impact and behavioral change quickly turned into a working MVP that tracks green habits, rewards users with points, and allows them to redeem those points for real-world or in-app benefits. We combined tech, design, and purpose to make sustainability fun and accessible.

## 🧪 How the MVP Works

1. **Users sign up and log in.**
2. They complete **green habits** like biking to work or turning off lights.
3. Points are awarded and stored in a **points ledger**.
4. Users can:
   - Redeem points for rewards 
   - Join community or solo **challenges** 
   - Participate in local **events** 
   - Learn through educational content  and earn bonus points
   - Donate points for green causes 🌱

Everything is tracked with full relational integrity to ensure accurate data and easy reporting.
